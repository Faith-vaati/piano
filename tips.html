<!-- he ::before selector creates a pseudo-element which is the first child of the selected element, while the ::after selector creates a pseudo-element which is the last child of the selected element. These pseudo-elements are often used to create cosmetic content, which you will see later in this project.





he @media at-rule, also known as a media query, is used to conditionally apply CSS. Media queries are commonly used to apply CSS based on the viewport width using the max-width and min-width properties.

In the below example the padding is applied to the .card class when the viewport is 960px wide and below.

@media (max-width: 960px) {
  .card {
    padding: 2rem;
  }
}



Logical operators can be used to construct more complex media queries. The and logical operator is used to query two media conditions.

For example, a media query that targets a display width between 500px and 1000px would be:

@media (min-width: 500px) and (max-width: 1000px){

} -->
